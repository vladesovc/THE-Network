## Description
   The motivation behind the project is to help create a social connectiion application that helps bring people together and share, thoughts and give others the ability to react to those thoughts. IT was made for that purpose, of being able to share my more intimate thoughts with those who I want to add as my friend. It will help me feel closer to all of my friends and family. It solves the problem of not being able to talk to friends who you might see on a daily basis, or family that lives in anither state. This application allows friends and family to communicate about each others day and discuss it. I learned that alot of times I over think what is usually a simple answer, or silly mistake. I often think this code is WAY more difficult or loarger than it is and that casues me to overthink and overcode.

  The usage of this application is to add and remove the friends of your choice, while also submitting your own "thoughts" for others to view and possibly react to! You can also delete any thoughts you have if you change your mind along with any reactions you make too! Once you delete yourself EVERYTHING goes with it so be careful!
